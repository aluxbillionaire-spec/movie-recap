## ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS REQUIRING IMPROVEMENT

### 1. Frontend Development Server Issues
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Import/export inconsistencies causing build failures
- Button component export issues in `DashboardPage.tsx`
- Character encoding problems in `TestPage.tsx` (resolved)
- Dev server instability requiring restarts

**Recommended Actions:**
- Standardize component exports using default exports
- Implement proper TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Add pre-commit hooks for code quality validation

### 2. Environment Configuration
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Missing environment variables for production deployment
- 18 critical environment variables undefined (DOMAIN, DB credentials, secrets)
- No .env templates provided for different environments

**Recommended Actions:**
```bash
# Create environment templates
.env.local.template
.env.staging.template  
.env.production.template
```

**Required Variables:**
```
DOMAIN=your-domain.com
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
DB_NAME=movie_recap_global
SECRET_KEY=jwt_secret_key
REDIS_PASSWORD=redis_password
GRAFANA_USER=admin
GRAFANA_PASSWORD=secure_password
CDN_URL=https://cdn.your-domain.com
REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=movie-recap-assets
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_s3_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_s3_secret
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio_key
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minio_secret
ACME_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
```

### 3. Backend Compatibility Issues
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** Python 3.13 + SQLAlchemy compatibility problems
- Main backend server fails to start due to dependency conflicts
- Workaround test API created but main app needs fixing

**Recommended Actions:**
- Update SQLAlchemy to latest compatible version
- Implement proper dependency version pinning
- Create comprehensive requirements.txt with version locks

### 4. Frontend Build Optimization
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** Build process showing warnings and slow compilation
- ESBuild warnings about file permissions
- Port conflicts requiring automatic port selection

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement proper build optimization
- Configure Vite for production builds
- Add build caching strategies
